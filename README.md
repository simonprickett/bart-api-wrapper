# BART API Wrapper

Detail coming...

# TODO 

* Standardize key name format across different parts of the API
* Centrally change all *flag and other boolean keys from 0/1 values to true/false
* Add full name of destination station for each leg in the route response to capture full names of stations that the rider has to change at
* Combine station access and station info, or at least provide one call that returns both
* Implement a cache layer
* Implement the geo query for stations nearby
